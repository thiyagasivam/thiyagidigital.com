# CONTACT FORM EMAIL CONFIGURATION GUIDE

## Current Issue
The contact form is not working because XAMPP doesn't have a built-in mail server configured.

## Quick Fixes Applied

### 1. Contact Form Improvements
- ✅ Fixed field name mismatch (service dropdown was using wrong field name)
- ✅ Added proper form validation (client-side and server-side)
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Added better user feedback
- ✅ Fixed both main contact form and side form

### 2. Email Configuration Options

#### Option A: Use the Improved Mailer (Current Setup)
- File: `mailer_improved.php`
- Features: Better error handling, detailed logging, user-friendly error pages
- Status: **Currently Active**

#### Option B: Configure XAMPP with Gmail SMTP
Edit `php.ini` file in XAMPP and add:
```
[mail function]
SMTP = smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port = 587
sendmail_from = your-email@gmail.com
sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
```

Then edit `sendmail.ini`:
```
[sendmail]
smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
smtp_ssl=tls
default_domain=gmail.com
auth_username=your-email@gmail.com
auth_password=your-app-password
force_sender=your-email@gmail.com
```

#### Option C: Use PHPMailer Library
Install PHPMailer for more reliable email delivery with proper SMTP authentication.
