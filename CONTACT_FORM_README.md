## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

1. **Check PHP mail configuration:**
   ```php
   <?php
   // Test script
   $result = mail('your@email.com', 'Test', 'Test message');
   echo $result ? 'Mail works!' : 'Mail failed!';
   ?>
   ```

2. **Check server mail logs:**
   - Linux: `/var/log/mail.log`
   - XAMPP: Check PHP error log

3. **Alternative: Use SMTP**
   - Install PHPMailer
   - Configure SMTP settings

### Upload Not Working?

1. **Check folder permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod 755 uploads/
   chmod 755 uploads/contact_attachments/
   ```

2. **Verify PHP upload settings in php.ini:**
   ```ini
   upload_max_filesize = 5M
   post_max_size = 6M
   file_uploads = On
   ```

### Clean URLs Not Working?

1. **Enable mod_rewrite in Apache:**
   ```bash
   a2enmod rewrite
   service apache2 restart
   ```

2. **Check .htaccess is being read:**
   - Ensure AllowOverride is set to All in Apache config

3. **Verify .htaccess exists and has correct content**

### Can't Access Admin Panel?

1. **URL should be:** `admin_contacts.php?pass=thiyagi2024`
2. **Check password in admin_contacts.php line 7**
3. **No clean URL for admin panel** (security feature)
