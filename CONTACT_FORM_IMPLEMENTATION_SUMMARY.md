   - Saves data to JSON and TXT files
   - Sends email to TO and CC addresses with attachment
   - Updates status if email sent successfully

3. **User redirected to** `thankyou` (thankyou.php)
   - Professional thank you message
   - Shows next steps
   - Contact information for immediate assistance

4. **Admin can view submissions** at `admin_contacts.php?pass=thiyagi2024`
   - See all submissions (even if email failed)
   - View attachment information
   - Statistics dashboard
   - Click-to-call and click-to-email links
