# EMAIL CONFIGURATION GUIDE - ThiyagiDigital Contact Form

## Current Status
✅ **Form Processing**: Working perfectly - captures data, validates, redirects to thank you page
✅ **Data Storage**: All submissions saved to `contact_submissions.json` and `contact_submissions.txt`
✅ **Admin Panel**: View all submissions at `admin_contacts.php?pass=thiyagi2024`
⚠️ **Email Delivery**: May not work on XAMPP localhost - requires SMTP configuration

## Files Overview
- `contact.php` - Main contact form with validation
- `mailer_improved.php` - Robust mailer that always saves data
- `thankyou.php` - Professional thank you page
- `admin_contacts.php` - Admin panel to view all submissions
- `contact_submissions.json` - JSON format data storage
- `contact_submissions.txt` - Human readable data storage
- `contact_status.log` - Email success/failure log

## XAMPP Local Testing
In XAMPP, emails may not send but the form will still:
1. Validate user input
2. Save all form data to files
3. Redirect to thank you page
4. Log all activities

You can view submissions in the admin panel even if emails fail.

## Production Email Setup Options

### Option 1: Web Hosting SMTP (Recommended)
Most web hosting providers have SMTP configured. Just upload the files and it should work.

### Option 2: Gmail SMTP (For testing)
Add this to your PHP configuration or use PHPMailer:
```php
// Gmail SMTP settings
ini_set('SMTP', 'smtp.gmail.com');
ini_set('smtp_port', 587);
ini_set('sendmail_from', 'your-email@gmail.com');
```

### Option 3: PHPMailer Library (Advanced)
For more reliable email delivery, consider using PHPMailer with SMTP authentication.

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Form Submission
1. Go to `contact.php`
2. Fill out the form
3. Submit - you should be redirected to `thankyou.php`

### 2. Check Data Storage
1. Go to `admin_contacts.php?pass=thiyagi2024`
2. You should see the submission even if email failed

### 3. Check Log Files
- `contact_status.log` - Shows email success/failure
- `contact_errors.log` - Shows any errors
- `contact_submissions.txt` - Readable format of all submissions

## Admin Panel Access
URL: `your-domain.com/admin_contacts.php?pass=thiyagi2024`
Password: `thiyagi2024` (change this in the file!)

## Email Recipients
The system tries to send emails to:
- info@thiyagidigital.com (primary)
- thiyagasivamp@gmail.com (copy)
- kannasivamps@gmail.com (copy)

## Security Notes
1. Change the admin password in `admin_contacts.php`
2. Consider adding IP restrictions to admin panel
3. Regularly backup the submission files
4. Consider using HTTPS for form submissions

## Troubleshooting

### Form submits but no email received
- Check `admin_contacts.php` to confirm data was saved
- Check `contact_status.log` for email status
- Emails may be in spam folder
- SMTP may need configuration

### Form doesn't submit at all
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify form action points to `mailer_improved.php`
- Check PHP error logs

### Data not being saved
- Check file permissions on the directory
- Verify PHP has write access
- Check PHP error logs

## Success Indicators
✅ Form data appears in admin panel
✅ User is redirected to thank you page
✅ Log files are being updated
✅ No JavaScript errors in browser console

The system is designed to NEVER lose form submissions, even if email delivery fails.
