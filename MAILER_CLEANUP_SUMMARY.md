### 📊 **Impact Analysis:**

- **All sidebar forms** (across all service pages) → Now use `contact-action.php` ✅
- **File uploads** → Working with new system ✅
- **Email notifications** → TO and CC addresses ✅
- **Data storage** → JSON and TXT files ✅
- **Admin dashboard** → `admin_contacts.php` ✅

#### 📋 **Sidebar Forms Updated:**
The sidebar form (`sideform.php`) is included in these pages:
- All service pages (*-service.php)
- All city pages (*-city.php) 
- Various other pages across the site

**All of these now use the unified contact system!**

### 🔗 **Current Contact System Architecture:**

```
Contact Forms Flow:

├── Sidebar Forms (sideform.php) 
│   └── → contact-action.php
└── Debug Test Form (contact-debug-test.php)
    └── → contact-action-debug.php
```

**Data Storage:**
- ✅ `contact_submissions.json` - Structured data for admin panel
- ✅ `contact_submissions.txt` - Human-readable backup
- ✅ `uploads/contact_attachments/` - File uploads

**Admin Access:**
- ✅ `admin_contacts.php?pass=thiyagi2024` - View all submissions
